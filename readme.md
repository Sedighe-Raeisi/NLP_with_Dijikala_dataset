# Sentiment prediction of digikala customers post with machine learnings
In this project I downloaded the dataset of comments of customers of digikala from kaggle.   
These coments were either positive, negativie or neutral.    
The following pie chart shows the distribution of each group.   

I used the Hazm library to clean the texts. The cleaning process includs the normalization , tokenizing, removing stop words and stemming. 
Then I used the TfIdf vectorization to vectorize the texts. 
#Random Forest Classifier ACC=80   
After vectorization I used the Random Forest classifier of sklearn. Here is the confusion matrix 

#SGD Classifier ACC=79  
I also used the SGD classifier of sklearn and here is the confusion matrix.
